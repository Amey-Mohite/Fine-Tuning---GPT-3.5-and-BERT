# Advanced NLP Models Repository

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks, `gpt35.ipynb` and `BERT.ipynb`, focusing on advanced NLP models' application to empathetic response generation and conversational AI. Each notebook offers detailed insights, methodology, and results for two distinct models - one presumably a GPT-variant and the other BERT - across two specific datasets.

## gpt35.ipynb

This notebook explores the applications of advanced generative models (presumed to be a variant of the GPT model) on:

### 1. Empathetic Dataset
- **Objective**: Utilize the model to analyze or generate empathetic responses, enhancing AI's emotional engagement capabilities.
- **Approach**: The notebook likely details dataset preprocessing, model training, and fine-tuning, followed by evaluation metrics that reflect the model's ability to understand and generate empathetic responses.

### 2. conv_ai_2 Dataset
- **Objective**: Apply the model to improve conversational AI elements, focusing on response relevance, engagement, and context understanding.
- **Approach**: Includes steps such as data cleaning, model adaptation to conversational data, training process, and an evaluation based on conversational metrics.

## BERT.ipynb

This notebook showcases the adaptation and fine-tuning of the BERT model for:

### BERT Empathetic
- **Overview**: Fine-tuning `bert-base-uncased` to enhance understanding and generation of empathetic dialogue responses.
- **Details**: 
  - Data preparation from the "empathetic_dialogues" dataset.
  - Model training and fine-tuning steps with detailed explanations.
  - Evaluation using metrics like F1 score, showcasing improvements in empathy understanding.

### BERT CONVAI2
- **Overview**: Application of BERT to the `conv_ai_2` dataset, aiming to refine conversational AI systems.
- **Details**:
  - Similar structured approach as BERT Empathetic, adjusted for conversational data.
  - Focus on training BERT to handle nuanced conversational contexts, evaluating improvements in dialogue generation or understanding.

## Usage
